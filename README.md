# Max 3SAT
### Andrew G. Neumann

## Run test cases and benchmarks:
```sh
sh ./run_test_cases.sh
```

## Provide input to exact solution:
```sh
python3 code_solution/cs412_max3sat_exact.py
```
## Provide input to approximate solution:
```sh
python3 code_solution/cs412_max3sat_approx.py
```

Note: There is also an old folder in code_solution that contains code for LP and TSP.
Originally I thought we were supposed to do three problems.
